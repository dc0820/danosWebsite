# Daniel Cook

Born in San Antonio, Texas, I was introduced to computers by my dad, who was in the Air Force. I started building computers at the age of 5, and by 11 I had built over 10 computers. By 14, I was diving into security software and exploring Kali Linux across multiple platforms.

From 2020 to 2024, I studied at the University of Texas at San Antonio, where I focused on cybersecurity and hands-on technical experience.
